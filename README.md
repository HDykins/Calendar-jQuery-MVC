# Calendar-jQuery-MVC

Interactive Calendar for any month created using jQuery. The calendar can act like a planner in that it can store text inputs and locations on clicking the day, so that you can plan events for each day. Clicking a planned event allows you to edit the stored text and change the location of the event. There a separate map view that shows all the planned events and their locations on a map, which can be filtered by date using a slider.

This project shows that I understand the MVC structure and the importance of splitting up code into easily testable units. The code in comparison to my previous version is much easier to maintain and alter, making it open to future customization. In addition to the restructuring, this version works for any month and has more features: Users can input a postcode which obtain the lat and lng of that postcode. With this, users can set the location of the event, which displays in the map view along-side the user inputted text for that event, and filter it based on the day number using a slider. This shows that I understand how to implement google maps and how to perform a GET request to abstract data from the postcodes.io API. It also shows that I can use the jQuery slider UI to filter what is rendered on the screen. The code is split into modules that do not depend or reference each other but are all accessed by a central controller module through which every command is passed.
